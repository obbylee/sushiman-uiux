## 🙏 Learning & Acknowledgments

This project is a direct result of the incredible learning resources provided by **jsmastery.pro** and **Adrian Hajdin ([@adrianhajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin))**. I am a student who learned and replicated their outstanding UI/UX design and initial code structure. My work in this repository focuses on rebuilding and modernizing that foundational knowledge using a different, newer tech stack (Next.js, Tailwind CSS v4+, and Framer Motion).

Huge thanks to them for creating such valuable educational content!
